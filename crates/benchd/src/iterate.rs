/// is an ANALYSIS-time decision on the emitted per-label records, not a benchd one.

/// `close_phase` `Err`, the time-only pass failing after a correctness failure, the
/// window-too-short guard, the timed pass failing — returns through the ONE `failed()` closure at
/// `QwenRuntimeLocalIterate.swift@b26f76f:40-74`, which forwards error/correctness/digests and
/// names no baseline argument, so `failedScore`'s defaults stand
/// (`QwenRuntimeBenchmark.swift@b26f76f:1130-1131`). The official side agrees independently: its
/// `baseline*SecondsPerToken` locals are INITIALISED to those constants
/// (`QwenRuntimeBenchmark.swift@b26f76f:33-34,350-351`), so a failure before the timed phase seals
/// them unchanged.
///
/// Setting them HERE rather than at each exit is deliberate: #74's fix landed only on
/// `preflight_failed_payload`, which left five locally-reachable sites still zeroing the pair
/// (#132) — a per-site override is exactly the shape that let them drift apart. Callers whose
/// phase actually resolved a pair overwrite these via `apply_timing_metrics`; callers that never
/// got that far now inherit the reference's values instead of a zero the reference never emits.
///
/// **The OFFICIAL path does not take this default (#132/F-2).** There the reference overwrites its
/// baseline locals with `pairedBaseline ?? benchmarkGolden.resolvedBaseline*`
/// (`QwenRuntimeBenchmark.swift@b26f76f:442-445`) before the gates-only branch and before every
/// failure record, so those payloads carry the RESOLVED pair, not these constants. The three
/// official sites nothing else overwrites set it explicitly — see
/// `official::official_resolved_baselines`. This default is the LOCAL surface's answer.
///
/// NOTE this does NOT touch `golden_hash` / `case_count` / `checked_steps`, and must not.
/// **RULED (David 2026-08-20, interview — FINAL) — #132(b): MIRROR BLANK STRICTLY.** Every local

/// reverses an earlier same-day ruling (keep-real-values + declare) — the deciding point is that
/// the reference's `goldenHash` carries an INVARIANT, *non-empty means correctness completed*,
/// because it is only ever populated from a `CorrectnessReport` that exists

/// Sealing benchd's real digest where correctness did not complete makes that field mean something
/// weaker for every consumer that trusts it. benchd's real data lives in LOGS.
///
/// The blank is applied by [`failed_payload`], not here, and that placement is load-bearing:
/// `base_metrics` also feeds the #73 RETAIN-TIMING arm and the PASSING path, where the reference
/// DOES seal real values because its `correctnessReport` is set
/// (`QwenRuntimeLocalIterate.swift@b26f76f:152`, checked at `:164-174`). Blanking here would take

/// `correctness_failure_retains_what_early_refuse_seals_empty` (the arm that must NOT blank).
///
/// **F1 — `harness_hash` is SEALED HERE, on every path.** This is the one funnel every `iterate`

/// WHAT IS SEALED, AND WHY EACH.
///
/// * `per_prompt` — one entry for the ONE prompt this leg timed, identified BY BYTES with the
///   golden's own sha256. Entries are never invented for prompts the run did not measure.
/// * `effective_spec_mode` / `effective_spec_depth` — WHAT SPECULATED. When the leg carried a spec,
///   this is the engine's own `effective_spec` ECHO, already validated equal to benchd's request
///   (spec-never-ignored). When it carried NONE, benchd requested the engine's default path, which
///   the protocol defines as serial — so the leg seals `serial` / depth `0` rather than leaving the
///   scored run with no statement of what ran at all.
/// * The COUNTERS (`spec_rounds`, `spec_drafted_total`, `spec_accepted_total`,
///   `spec_acceptance_rate`, `spec_verify_replay_disagreements`, `acceptance_lengths`) — only on a
///   leg that actually DRAFTED (`depth > 0`). On a serial leg they are structurally constant
///   (nothing drafted, one committed token per round, `acceptance_lengths` an all-ones vector of
///   length N), so sealing them would add N entries of pure noise to every serial score.
///   `spec_acceptance_rate` is further omitted when nothing was drafted: a zero denominator has no
///   rate, and `0.0` would read as "drafted plenty, accepted none".
///   `spec_verify_replay_disagreements` is further omitted when the ENGINE did not report the
///   counter at all — the wire field is optional, and `0` would claim a measurement the engine
///   never made.
///
/// NOTHING ENFORCED CHANGES. Every value here is AUDIT-ONLY: none feeds a seconds-per-token, a
/// speedup, a floor, a band or the score. `mtp_seconds_per_token_mean` is READ BACK from
