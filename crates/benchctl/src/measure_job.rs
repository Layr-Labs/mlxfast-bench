// COMPOSITE COHORT SCORING (Gemma track, David ruling 2026-08-23, verbatim)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// "we want to score gemma's benchmark on prefill gains ^ .25 * decode ^ .75. The numbers used
// will be the aggregate across all 8 (summed)" / "so when we get a baseline from the 8 baseline
// prompts, we add their numbers together" / "same with the 8 golden prompts".
//
// Interpretation: RATIO OF SUMS, both legs, per component. Per leg, per component, the 8 streams'
// numbers are aggregated to ONE cohort figure ("added together"); component gain =
// baseline_aggregate / candidate_aggregate (serial-anchored, matching the existing convention: a
// faster candidate scores > 1); composite = prefill_gain ^ 0.25 * decode_gain ^ 0.75 — the
// classic challenge overlay form (`decode_speedup ^ 0.75 * prefill_speedup ^ 0.25`), applied here
// to the two COHORT-level gains rather than two single-number legs.
//
// SHARED-WINDOW RULING (David, superseding the 2026-08-23 per-stream-sums reading) — the
// composite's per-component aggregate is benchd's OWN PARENT-CLOCKED SHARED WINDOW, summed over
// the accepted pairs. ZERO engine-reported input feeds the score, so the composite has NO
// attestation surface to defend at all. [`shared_window_composite`] is the whole scoring path.
//
// WHY (the security argument, recorded here because it is the reason the design is what it is):
//
//  1. An earlier revision read "add their numbers together" as PER-STREAM SUMS. That
//     implementation was BLOCKED in audit: its inputs are the ENGINE-REPORTED per-slot ns vectors
//     (`prefill_ns_by_stream` / `decode_ns_by_stream`), and their attestation
//     (`bench_core::per_stream_attestation`) FLAGS but never REFUSES — a candidate reporting
//     `decode_ns_by_stream = [1; 8]` scores a decode gain around 2e10 with nothing in the
//     pipeline stopping it. benchd's standing parent-clock doctrine (`bench_runner::timing`)
//     distrusts engine self-timed durations for anything SCORED; a published score is precisely
//     where that doctrine has to bite.
//
//  2. The same audit PROVED the two readings EQUIVALENT on the geometry this track runs. The
//     cohort is RECTANGULAR LOCKSTEP — B streams, one fixed budget N, no EOS, no refill — already
//     enforced by the cohort consistency QUADRUPLE (`bench_core::free_run::verify_cohort_
//     consistency`) and the D4 fixed-budget rule. Writing ᾱ for a leg's mean per-stream
//     ATTRIBUTION factor (a stream's reported time / that leg's parent window), the two
//     aggregates relate as `G_sum = G_window × ᾱˢ / ᾱᶜ`; with honest attribution (α ≡ 1) they are
//     IDENTICAL. The α-ratio is not measurement — it is attacker-controlled ATTRIBUTION, i.e.
//     pure gaming surface bolted onto a quantity the parent clock already knows exactly.
//
// So SHARED-WINDOW is not an approximation of the per-stream reading: on this geometry it IS that
// reading, minus the attack. David ruled the now-redundant per-stream SCORING machinery removed;
// #188/#189's per-stream carry and attestation SEAL stay merged untouched as REPORT-ONLY
// diagnostics (box-calibration evidence, never a scored input).
//
// AGGREGATION, per component — RATIO OF SUMS across the ACCEPTED PAIRS, serial numerator:
//
//     prefill_gain = Σ_pairs serial_prefill_window_seconds / Σ_pairs candidate_prefill_window_seconds
//     decode_gain  = Σ_pairs serial_decode_window_seconds  / Σ_pairs candidate_decode_window_seconds
//     composite    = prefill_gain ^ exp_prefill * decode_gain ^ exp_decode
//
// Ratio-of-sums (NOT mean-of-per-pair-ratios, NOT a median of them) is the direct translation of
// "we add their numbers together", and is exactly the shape the per-stream-sum reading has at
// α ≡ 1 — the equivalence above is stated per component and survives the pair-level sum because
// both legs of every pair time the same rectangular cohort.
