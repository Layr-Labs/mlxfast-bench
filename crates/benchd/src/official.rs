//! B-2 — `benchd` OFFICIAL benchmark path, at parity with the Swift official run
//! (`QwenRuntimeBenchmark.benchmarkWithWorker`, main.swift official gating, benchmark.sh).
//!
//! The official path diverges from the local checked-timing path (`crate::iterate`) in
//! several load-bearing ways, all corrected from the original steer against the read-first
//! Swift map:
//!
//! 1. **Timed-runs FIRST, then gates** (cold-path / anti-memoization defense,
//!    Constants.swift:82-88): prefill → decode → floor/band/finite evaluation →
//!    correctness. The timed phases run before any correctness so the measured path is
//!    never warmed by the gates (QwenRuntimeBenchmark.swift:466-558 precede :560-581).
//! 2. **THREE fresh sandboxed workers** — a dedicated `RuntimeWorkerClient` per phase
//!    (prefill :469-484, decode :486-503, correctness :565-581), each closed/reaped before
//!    the next. No shared session, no warm caches across phases.
//! 3. **Full correctness set** — base cases + anchors + free_run (+ behavior/GPQA on the
//!    GPU path): `checkGates == true` ⇒ `caseCount = totalCorrectnessCaseCount`,
//!    `gates = correctnessGates` (QwenRuntimeCorrectness.swift:351/435). Contrast local's
//!    base-cases-only default.
//! 4. **128-step decode window + benchmark-ORACLE checks** (Constants.swift:70, seed 512):
//!    every timed token is verified against `golden.benchmark.expected_*`; a corrupted
//!    oracle FAILS official (`BenchmarkTokenMismatchError`) — the failure class the local
//!    path structurally cannot test.
//! 5. **Official gating** — 0.95 speedup floors, prefill band ±5% / decode +2%−5%, and a
//!    non-finite score fails, evaluated BEFORE correctness (Score.swift:50-126).
//! 6. **Sealing/integrity** — the sealed stdout payload is the coarsened score (2-sig-fig
//!    diagnostics, ranking fields untouched); the `metrics.commit` carries the resolved
//!    commit identifier (official-only).
//!
//! The SANDBOX fail-closed spawn + Seatbelt profile live in `bench_runner::sandbox`; this
//! module owns the phase orchestration + scoring. The REAL timed measurement and the
//! end-to-end both-sides run are B-3 on the GPU box — this module is macOS-buildable and
//! unit-tested against a stub `MockEngine` (no real engine, no GPU).

/// WHY THIS EXISTS. The free-run decode measurement computes
/// [`bench_core::free_run::FreeRunAudit::effective_mean_draft_len`] on every timed leg, but the two
/// free-run producers in `bench-runner/src/timing.rs` used to drop the whole audit when they
/// narrowed into [`TimingResult`], so the single-leg official path had nothing to seal and the board
/// showed a dash. The value now rides on `TimingResult::effective_mean_draft_len`.
///
/// ONE ENTRY, NEVER MORE. Official times the golden's benchmark oracle — ONE prompt — so exactly one
/// record is sealed; entries are never invented for pool prompts this run did not measure. The
/// identity is the golden's own sha256 (BIND BY BYTES), the same identity `metrics.golden_hash`
/// carries and the same rule the paired flow uses for its records.
///
/// NOTHING ENFORCED CHANGES. `mtp_seconds_per_token_mean` is READ BACK from
/// `metrics.decode_seconds_per_token` — the enforced whole-window figure `apply_timing_metrics` just
/// wrote — so the two cannot drift and no second, decode-only quantity is introduced (the RED-TEAM
/// REVERT notes in `bench-runner/src/timing.rs`). The array is additive: it feeds no score, floor or
/// band.
///
/// NO `head_provenance_sha256`. The engine's loaded-head digest arrives on the `hello`
/// (`bench_runner::Hello::head_provenance`), which the timed-worker spawn closures discard — a
/// [`Session`] does not retain it, and neither does [`TimingResult`]. The official path therefore has
/// no head digest in hand at this point, so the key is OMITTED rather than invented. The board reads
/// it optionally and simply flags no custom head.
///
/// WHERE IT IS SEALED, AND WHY THAT IS NOT THE #132(b) BLANK. The call sites are the three official
/// payloads that RETAIN the real measured timing surface: the passing score and the two
/// failed-with-timing builders. `per_prompt` belongs to that timing surface — both its numbers
/// describe the timed decode window that really ran — so it rides with the retained half. It is NOT
/// part of the correctness-derived surface `official_failed_timed_band` blanks to match Swift: that
/// blank exists because a non-empty `golden_hash` asserts "correctness completed", and
/// `prompt_sha256` asserts something else entirely, namely which prompt the clock measured. A

/// `backend` string carries the engine pin, overlay, nvcc and driver — all of it identity a scored
/// artifact should carry.
///
/// AUDIT-ONLY, ADDITIVE, FAIL-SOFT. Nothing here is scored, gated or compared: an engine that omits
/// a field simply seals no key for it (`skip_serializing_if`), so a pre-#106 engine's score is
/// byte-unchanged. The score is NOT refused on a divergence between the timed and correctness
