//! #134 — the worker-stderr blackout on the hello-handshake path, and its regression fence.
//!
//! Proof A died on every leg with a bare `engine closed the stream before returning a response`
//! and NOT ONE `mlxfast-worker:` line in any run record, which made the failure undiagnosable
//! from the artifacts alone. These tests drive the REAL spawn + `Session::connect` path against
//! scripted fake workers covering each way an engine can end its stream, and assert that benchd's
//! error now carries the engine's own last words (wait status + redacted stderr tail).
//!
//! Unix-only: the fake workers are `/bin/sh` scripts.
