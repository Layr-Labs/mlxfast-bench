//! NEAR-TIE STATS SEAL — the REPORT-ONLY measurement behind the (b) tolerance gate's
//! batched-oracle rounding channel (David's ruling "hold 10% + seal near-tie stats", 2026-08-25;
//! the audit's final "measured, not argued" conditional).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. The ≤10% per-stream tolerance gate
//! ([`crate::cohort_tolerance::evaluate_cohort_token_tolerance`]) judges the candidate's committed
//! tokens against the TRUSTED oracle's `sequential_argmax`. That oracle replays the cohort
//! BATCHED, so cross-stream floating-point geometry can perturb the reference logits by a hair. At
//! a position where the reference's top-1 and top-2 are separated by less than that perturbation,
//! the argmax the oracle reports is not robust — a "flippable near-tie". The audit rated this
//! channel REAL BUT LOW-EXPLOITABILITY, bounded by the raw-mismatch budget, and flagged the bound
//! as ARGUED rather than MEASURED. This module MEASURES it: it counts, per run, how many positions
//! are flippable near-ties and how they overlap the positions that actually mismatched, so the
//! organizer can confirm empirically that the flippable set stays small relative to the
//! [`crate::constants::COHORT_TOKEN_TOLERANCE_PER_THOUSAND`] budget — and gets an EARLY WARNING
//! when an honest submission creeps toward the thin margin (the honest drama case is 9.38% against
//! a 10% bar: 12 mismatches of 128).
//!
//! REPORT-ONLY, STRUCTURALLY. Every function here is TOTAL over well-shaped inputs and returns a
//! value, never a verdict: there is no pass/fail, no threshold comparison that any caller could
//! read as a decision, and no error type that could reach a reject path. The one fallible entry
//! point ([`near_tie_stats`]) fails ONLY on shapes the tolerance gate itself already refuses
//! upstream ([`crate::cohort_tolerance::CohortToleranceError`]), and its caller folds that into a
//! NAMED seal refusal instead of a rejection. Nothing in `candidate_accepted` or any
//! `RejectClass` may ever read these numbers.
//!
//! ── NEAR-TIE DEFINITION (the gap index and the envelope semantics) ─────────────────────────────
//!
//! The oracle's per-position `ranked_relative_gaps` is, per the ENGINE's own definition
//! (`mlxfast-gemma4-26b-a4b-engine@6aed6594`,
//! `Sources/MLXFastHarness/QwenRuntimeCohortReferenceReplay.swift:103-104` — "Relative ratio of
//! each rank's gap from top-1: `(top1 - rank_i)/max(1,|top1|)`" — produced by
//! `Sources/MLXFastHarness/QwenRuntimeWidthProbe.swift:215-216,238-253`
//! `rankedReferenceCharacterization`):
//!
//! ```text
//!     ranked_relative_gaps[i] = (top1_logit - rank_i_logit) / max(1, |top1_logit|)
//! ```
//!
//! rank-0 first, descending logit. So `ranked_relative_gaps[0] == 0.0` ALWAYS (top-1 against
//! itself), and **index [`NEAR_TIE_GAP_INDEX`] == 1 is the top-1→top-2 relative gap** — the only
//! index that can state "how close was the runner-up to winning". That index, and no other, is
//! what this module reads.
//!
//! The envelope is the report-level `rel_envelope`, the SAME scale the engine already compares
//! these gaps against: `within_envelope_depth` is defined as "Count of ranks whose relative ratio
//! `<=` the envelope (top-1 included, so >= 1)" (`QwenRuntimeWidthProbe.swift:217-219,251`). A
//! position is therefore a NEAR-TIE here iff
//!
//! ```text
//!     ranked_relative_gaps[1] <= rel_envelope
//! ```
//!
//! using the engine's own INCLUSIVE `<=`, which makes this predicate EXACTLY equivalent to the
//! engine's `within_envelope_depth >= 2`. Choosing `<` instead, or index 0 (always 0.0 ⇒ every
//! position "near-tie") or index 2 (the top-1→top-3 gap ⇒ an over-count), all produce different
//! numbers; the seal tests pin the values so those mutations are visible.
//!
//! ── WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//!
//! Per stream, over its committed positions:
//!  * `mismatches` — committed != `sequential_argmax`. THE gate's numerator (recounted here from
//!    the same per-position inputs so the seal is self-contained; it must agree with the gate's
//!    tally by construction — [`crate::cohort_tolerance`] counts the identical predicate).
//!  * `near_tie_positions` — positions where the REFERENCE's top-2 gap is inside the envelope,
//!    i.e. where batch geometry could plausibly have flipped the reported argmax. This is a
//!    property of the REFERENCE distribution alone; it does not depend on what the candidate
//!    committed.
//!  * `near_tie_mismatches` — the OVERLAP: mismatches that ARE near-ties. These are the ones the
//!    rounding channel could account for.
//!  * `non_near_tie_mismatches` — mismatches that are NOT near-ties: the reference was CONFIDENT
//!    and the candidate still diverged. **This is the interesting signal** — genuine divergence,
//!    unattributable to batch geometry.
//!  * `min_committed_relative_gap_on_mismatch` / `median_committed_relative_gap_on_mismatch` — how
//!    deep in the reference's distribution the committed token sat, at the positions that
//!    mismatched. Near 0 ⇒ the candidate picked something the reference nearly picked; large ⇒ the
//!    candidate picked something the reference thought poorly of.
//!
//! And per cohort: the same quantities totalled, plus the HEADROOM stat —
//! `max_stream_mismatch_per_thousand` against `budget_per_thousand` — the single number the
//! organizer watches creep toward the bar.
