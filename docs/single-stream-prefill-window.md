# Single-stream prefill window (wire contract)

Ruling (David, 2026-08-27): score the Qwen 3.8 125B-A6B tracks (mlx and cuda)
single-stream, paired serial vs the built-in mtp, on
`prefill_gain ^ 0.25 * decode_gain ^ 0.75`. This page is the wire contract for the
prefill half of that score on the single-stream series. The engine side and the
bench side implement it from this page.

## 1. Summary

- No new message. No new field on the wire. The single-stream free-run verbs
  stay `free_decode_begin` and `free_decode_run`.
- benchd splits its own parent clock at the boundary between the two verbs.
- The engine does not emit a timing. The engine must do all seed-prefill work
  inside `free_decode_begin`.
- The track fixture declares `scored_batch_size: 1` and `scored_exponents`
  `{prefill_gain_exponent: 0.25, decode_gain_exponent: 0.75}`. Those are the
  exponents benchd raises the two gains to.

## 2. The two windows

benchd runs one fresh worker for each leg. For each leg it opens two
contiguous windows on its own clock (`std::time::Instant`):

| Window | Opens | Closes | Token count |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prefill_elapsed_seconds` | immediately before benchd sends `free_decode_begin` (with the golden's `decode_seed_tokens`, 1024 tokens, and the requested `spec`) | immediately after benchd validates the response `seed_token` against the golden's `expected_decode_seed_token` | `prefill_token_total` = `decode_seed_tokens.len()` |
| `decode_elapsed_seconds` | the instant the prefill window closes | when `free_decode_run(N)` returns | `decode_token_total` = `N` (128) |

Rules:

- There is no untimed gap between the two windows.
- `elapsed_seconds` = `prefill_elapsed_seconds + decode_elapsed_seconds`, by
  construction. benchd never measures the whole window a second time.
- `seconds_per_token` = `elapsed_seconds / N`. This is unchanged. It stays
  the enforced whole-window figure for the serial band, the run timeout and
  the paired decode-only median.
- The seed oracle check is charged to the prefill window. The run oracle check
  is outside both windows.
- The RunTimeout deadline is armed when the prefill window opens and covers
  both windows, as today.

## 3. Engine obligations

1. `free_decode_begin` must run the full seed prefill (all `decode_seed_tokens`)
   and must reply only after the seed forward is complete. The reply carries
   `seed_token` (the argmax after the full seed) and the echoed `effective_spec`.
2. `free_decode_run` must not prefill. It must decode from the state that
   `free_decode_begin` left. It must not re-run any part of the seed.
3. The engine must not do any prefill work before `free_decode_begin` arrives.
   benchd spawns a fresh worker for each timed leg, so there is no earlier
   state to reuse.
4. The hello must advertise `free_run_decode`. The single-stream series does
   not use `batched_free_run_decode` or `max_batch_size`. benchd does not read
   them on this series.
5. Units on the wire stay as they are. benchd's clock is in seconds (f64).

If the engine moves prefill work into `free_decode_run`, the prefill window
gets smaller and the decode window gets larger by the same amount. The whole
window does not change. The composite then moves against the engine, because
the decode exponent (0.75) is larger than the prefill exponent (0.25).

## 4. What benchd seals

The ranked path of these tracks is `benchd iterate --mode official`, and it seals
`score.json`. Per role it seals the per-token times of the legs
(`baseline_prefill_seconds_per_token`, `baseline_decode_seconds_per_token`,
`prefill_seconds_per_token`, `decode_seconds_per_token`), the two gains
(`prefill_speedup`, `decode_speedup`) and the composite as the run's `score`.
`metrics.paired_legs` carries one row for each measured pair.

The gains are ratios of the summed per-token times over the pairs the fixture
declares in `official_pairs`:

```
prefill_gain = sum(control prefill s/tok) / sum(candidate prefill s/tok)
decode_gain  = sum(control decode s/tok)  / sum(candidate decode s/tok)
composite    = prefill_gain ^ 0.25 * decode_gain ^ 0.75
```

The window split of section 2 is what makes the two gains separable. Without it
there is one whole-window number and no prefill half to score.

## 5. What does not change

- `free_decode_begin` / `free_decode_run` request and response fields.
- The captured engine-wire fixture (`ENGINE_WIRE_V1_SHA256`). No re-pin.
- The whole window and its `seconds_per_token`. The split cannot move them.
