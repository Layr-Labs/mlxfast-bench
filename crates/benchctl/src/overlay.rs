//! A-3 — the OVERLAY component of the Option-A paired ranked flow (seam 3, LOCAL).
//!
//! `benchctl overlay-timing` is benchd's LOCAL merge of the seam-1 producer's sealed `gates-score.json`
//! (seam 1, `partial_result=true`) with the measure-job's `results.json` (seam 2) into a sealed
//! ranked `score.json`. On the RANKED path the organizer's trusted shell owns seam 3 and authors
//! the published `score.json` (design note OPEN-2 CLOSED); this subcommand is the LOCAL-only
//! estimate AND the verifiable seam-3 PARITY reference — it mirrors the seam-3 semantics so a
//! local run matches what the organizer would seal. It does NOT wire a ranked `score.json` path
//! into production.
//!
//! Aggregation is the 3.8 MEDIAN regime (design note OPEN-1 CLOSED): the ranked score is the
//! median of the per-prompt raw ratio-of-means, serial-anchored, with NO no-op normalization,
//! per-pair plausibility bound 8.0 applied BEFORE aggregation, floor 0.90 / ceiling 5.0 on the
//! median. The numeric bounds + aggregation are the public 3.8 record
//! (`benchmark.qwen-mtp.json@3655c68d`); the DRAFT ranked merge STRUCTURE is
//! `qwen-mtp-ranked-benchmark.yml@064c0ff2:2108-2225`. The live-vs-draft diff is B-4, so the
//! aggregation choice carries `// UNVERIFIED(B-4)`.
//!
//! F1 CHANGE 2 — the overlay now consumes BOTH measurement shapes (see [`ResultsShape`]):
//!
//! * SINGLE-STREAM (`teacher_forced_v1`, `free_run_v1_1`) — one timed stream per pool prompt,
//!   `per_prompt` populated. Published score: the median regime described above, UNCHANGED.
//! * COHORT (`batched_free_run_v1_2_b8`) — the whole pool timed concurrently in ONE shared window,
//!   so `per_prompt` is empty by construction and the pool's identities live in
//!   `per_cohort[].members`. Published score: the sealed SHARED-WINDOW COMPOSITE
//!   (`prefill_gain^0.25 * decode_gain^0.75`), which is what a batched run measures — there are no
//!   per-prompt ratios to take a median of.
//!
//! This closes a seam that had never been runnable: the overlay knew only the two single-stream
//! regimes, so it refused its own measure-job's batched artifacts outright.
//!
//! The shape is read off the SERIES TAG, and the body must agree with it — a file cannot claim one
//! shape in its tag and carry the other's records. Everything the single-stream path enforces is
//! enforced on the cohort path too, over the unit that was actually measured: the gates-side harness
//! identity gate, the die-5 `candidate_accepted` verdict, the per-pair plausibility bound, the
//! sealed-median tamper detector (recomputed from the accepted pairs' cohort ratios), the pool
//! cardinality / identity / distinctness grid (over the members), and the 0.90 floor — applied to
//! the composite through the SAME reused `score_paired_decode_only` gate, so there is no second
//! scoring formula. The composite is additionally re-derived from its own sealed gains under the
//! RULED exponents before it is published.
//!
//! Merge semantics mirror the Gemma-era overlay reference
//! `mlxfast-challenge-dev/.github/scripts/overlay-paired-timing.sh@67699fc4`: flip
//! `partial_result → false` (`:159`), floor-fail null score + error prefix (`:161-168`), and
//! re-anchor integrity `score_sha256` over the merged bytes (`:177-181`).

/// A harness hash covers the workspace's ABSOLUTE location as well as its bytes

/// captures the gates leg's workspace root at gates time (`GATES_WS`) and `cd`s to exactly that root
/// before invoking `benchctl overlay-timing`, so this recompute — which is CWD-relative, exactly as
/// the reference's own production resolution is — resolves the gates leg's tree.
///
/// ## The parity oracle this doubles as
///
/// On the DEFAULT ranked flow (`GATES_PRODUCER=benchmark-sh`, RULING Q1a) the gates leg is the
/// ENGINE's SWIFT `QwenRuntime.harnessHash()` and this leg is benchd's RUST
/// `bench_core::harness_hash` port, over the same tree at the same absolute root. So the equality is
/// simultaneously a PER-RUN Swift↔Rust cross-implementation parity oracle on the port — live on
/// every ranked run, not just in the port's own test vectors. A port drift and a between-phase
/// mutation both surface here; both are refusals, and both are things a published score must not
