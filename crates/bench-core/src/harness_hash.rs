//! The TRUSTED-SIDE harness identity: a byte-compatible Rust port of the engine's `harnessHash()`.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in benchd (and must never come off the wire)
//!
//! `metrics.harness_hash` is a PUBLICATION-GATING value: the seam-3 overlay refuses to publish an
//! official score whose gates-score carries an empty or malformed harness identity
//! ([`crate::harness_hash`]'s consumer is `benchd::overlay::validate_gates`). Until F1 every
//! benchd-authored `gates-score.json` sealed `harness_hash = ""` — benchd had NO source for the
//! value — so no official score could publish.
//!
//! The value could NOT be sourced from the engine. The worker is PARTICIPANT-BUILT, so a
//! wire-reported hash would be attacker-controlled: a candidate could report the digest of a
//! harness it is not running. The computation therefore has to happen trusted-side, over the
//! workspace benchd itself drives — which is what this module does.
//!
//! ## The authoritative algorithm
//!
//! This is a byte-compatible port of the engines' own `harnessHash()`. There are now TWO reference
//! implementations, one per engine surface:
//!
//! * the MLX (Apple-silicon) engine's Swift
//!   `Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness/QwenRuntimePreflight.swift` — `QwenRuntime.harnessHashRoots`,
//!   `QwenRuntime.harnessHashRootFiles(baseDirectory:)` and `QwenRuntime.harnessHash()`;
//! * the CUDA engine's equivalent, over that engine's own roster surface (`harness/`, `vllm/`).
//!
//! Both compute the SAME algorithm over the roots that EXIST in their respective trees. This port is
//! byte-compatible with each: the same bytes go into SHA256, in the same order, so a benchd-computed
//! hash equals the one a reference implementation would compute over the same tree at the same
//! absolute location.
//!
//! Every semantic below was VERIFIED against a transcription of the reference symbols run against
//! synthetic trees (see the module tests for the resulting fixed-digest cross-implementation
//! regression vector and its provenance) — not inferred from reading:
//!
//! 1. **The hashed path strings are ABSOLUTE.** `URL(fileURLWithPath: root)` resolves a relative
//!    root against the process CWD and `.path` renders it absolute, so the digest covers the
//!    workspace's absolute location as well as its bytes. A harness hash is therefore an identity
//!    of *this tree at this path on this box*, NOT a portable content digest. (Surprising, but it
//!    is what the reference does, and byte-compatibility is the requirement.)
//! 2. **Production (`baseDirectory: nil`, CWD-relative) and an explicit fully-resolved
//!    `baseDirectory` produce the SAME digest** — verified equal on the same tree. That is the
//!    bridge this port stands on: [`harness_hash`] takes the workspace root explicitly, and
//!    [`harness_hash_of_current_dir`] passes `getcwd()` (always fully symlink-resolved, exactly
//!    what Foundation prepends), reproducing the reference's production path.
//! 3. **Ordering is over the FULL absolute path strings, globally** — `files.sorted()` in the
//!    reference, AFTER collection across all roots, so files from different roots interleave and the
//!    root declaration order does NOT affect the digest. ASCII ordering (`Sources/…` before
//!    `TASK.md` before `benchmark.json`) — Swift's `String` `<` and Rust's byte-wise `Ord` agree on
//!    ASCII, which every root name and every real workspace path is.
//! 4. **The hashed byte format is bare concatenation**: for each path in sorted order,
//!    `sha256.update(path.utf8)` then `sha256.update(file_bytes)`. NO separator, NO length prefix,
//!    NO trailing newline. Rendered as 64 lowercase hex characters.
//! 5. **An UNREADABLE file is skipped whole** — the reference's `guard let data = try?
//!    Data(contentsOf:) else { continue }` drops the path bytes too, not just the contents.
//! 6. **Hidden entries are skipped** (`.skipsHiddenFiles`): a dot-file inside a root, and a
//!    dot-directory's entire subtree, contribute nothing.
//! 7. **Symlinks inside a root directory are excluded entirely** — verified: a symlink to a file is
//!    not a regular file to `URLResourceValues` (no-follow), and the enumerator does not descend
//!    into a symlink to a directory. A symlinked root DIRECTORY therefore contributes zero files
//!    while still satisfying the existence probe (`fileExists` follows). A symlinked root FILE, by
//!    contrast, IS hashed with its target's bytes — the non-directory branch appends
//!    unconditionally, with no regular-file check, and the content read follows the link.
//! 8. **A MISSING root is LOGGED and SKIPPED, never a refusal.** The roster spans BOTH engine
//!    surfaces (MLX and CUDA), and neither engine has every root: the MLX tree has no `harness/` or
//!    `vllm/`, the CUDA tree has no `Package.swift`/`Sources`/`Tests`. Per David's ruling the hash
//!    is computed over what EXISTS — a root absent from disk contributes zero files (exactly as if
//!    it were an empty directory) and is noted on stderr so an operator can see what was covered.
//!    The SAME roster therefore serves both engines, and each hashes over its own surface.
