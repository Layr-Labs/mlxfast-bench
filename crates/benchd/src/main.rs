//! Absorbs benchmark.sh and the Swift harness targets. Only writer of score artifacts.
//! Emits score.json honoring the Yukon contract (finite `score`, optional metrics).
//!
//! This wave (WS1-8) implements `iterate`: drive a live engine (spawned over
//! `ChildStdioTransport`) through the correctness gate + WS1-6 parent-side timing and
//! write a sealed `score.json` (+ `.sha256` sidecar). `transform`/`submit`/`official`

/// (`Session::require_free_run_capability`) — the ~16 s pre-load refusal that blocked the MLX

/// argv (`bin/cuda-engine.rs` main reads config from the environment and NDJSON from stdin) and
/// advertises `free_run_decode` on its hello UNCONDITIONALLY (`adapter.rs`), so passing this flag
/// is inert there — a benchd-only change, no adapter edit.

/// MEASURED-NUMBER SAFETY. The flag only unblocks the capability the timed leg already intends to

benchd iterate — run the engine end-to-end and write a sealed score.json

USAGE:
    benchd iterate --engine <PATH> --weights <DIR> --golden <PATH> [OPTIONS]

REQUIRED:
    --engine <PATH>              Engine executable (spawned as `<engine> runtime-worker --weights <DIR>`)
    --weights <DIR>              Transformed weights directory
    --golden <PATH>              GoldenDocument JSON (loaded + validated by bench-core)

OPTIONS:
    --baseline-prefill-spt <F>   STORED-PAIR TRACKS ONLY, on --mode official. Prefill baseline
    --baseline-decode-spt <F>    seconds/token (trusted override; both required together; else the
                                 golden's declared pair). IGNORED on local-iterate/local-submit:
                                 those legs score against the track's CONSTANTS (#127). REFUSED BY
                                 NAME on the ranked paired path, which measures its denominator.
    --baseline-workspace <DIR>   PAIRED PATH (env MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE). The
                                 organizer-staged, built REFERENCE tree on this box. Leg 1 — the
                                 serial-control leg — runs the same root-relative engine AND
                                 weights paths inside this tree that leg 2 runs inside the
                                 submission tree, so the control leg never loads the candidate's
                                 participant-editable transform output.
    --baseline-calibration <F>   PAIRED PATH (env MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION). This box's
                                 calibration file (`benchd calibrate-baseline` writes it). It is
                                 the HEALTH BAND for leg 1 and never a denominator: a leg outside
                                 the band refuses by name and seals no score.
                                 REQUIRED on --mode official for a track that scores against a
                                 live control leg; both refuse by name when absent. On
                                 local-iterate/local-submit they are OPTIONAL: give BOTH to run
                                 the full paired path locally, or neither to run the CANDIDATE LEG
                                 ONLY and seal no score (real timings, real correctness,
                                 score=null, baseline_source=\"none (local mode: unscored)\").
    --box <RUNNER>               PAIRED PATH. The runner name this box answers to, for the
                                 calibration file's `box` check. RUNNER_NAME wins when set.
    --mode <local-iterate|local-submit|official>
                                 Decode window: 128 (local-iterate, default), 1023 (local-submit), 128 (official)
    --score-path <OUT>           Output score path (default: score.local-iterate.json for
                                 local-iterate; score.json for local-submit/official)
    --golden-sha256 <HEX>        Integrity pin: refuse the golden unless its sha256 matches
    --golden-bytes <N>           Integrity pin: refuse the golden unless its byte count matches
                                 (both pin flags must be given together; checked before parse)
    --cool-gate                  Force the local GPU cool-down gate ON before each timed phase.
    --no-cool-gate               Force the cool-down gate OFF (overrides the per-mode default,
                                 e.g. local-submit's default-ON).
                                 local-iterate defaults OFF (this opts in); local-submit ON.
    --strict                     local-iterate/local-submit: also evaluate the golden's
                                 anchor/free-run gates (benchd superset). Default is Swift-exact: the
                                 correctness gate checks only the primary teacher-forced
                                 cases[]. No effect on official mode.
    --capture-baseline <REC>     CAPTURE MODE, local-iterate ONLY (every other mode refuses at
                                 parse). Runs the checked-timing legs WITHOUT resolving this
                                 track's official baseline and appends the measured pair to the
                                 capture record <REC> (identity-checked; sample CVs; temp+rename).
                                 Writes NO score and NO integrity sidecar. A track whose official
                                 baseline is already captured refuses the mode BY NAME, so it can
                                 never double as a scoring bypass.
    --mtp-depth <N>              Request the native-MTP speculative leg at draft depth N on the
                                 TIMED free-run decode window: the wire spec becomes
                                 {\"mode\":\"mtp\",\"mtp\":{\"depth\":N}} and the engine's effective_spec
                                 echo MUST match it (spec-never-ignored) or the leg is discarded.
                                 ABSENT is SERIAL: no spec goes on the wire and the engine runs its
                                 default path, which is exactly today's behaviour. N must be >= 1
                                 (depth 0 IS serial — omit the flag) and within the draft-depth cap
                                 (32 on the official path, where MLXFAST_MAX_DRAFT_DEPTH is
                                 ignored). Mutually exclusive with --candidate-spec. The
                                 correctness gate is teacher-forced and never carries a spec.
    --candidate-spec <JSON>      The EXPLICIT spec object for the timed decode window, e.g.
                                 {\"mode\":\"mtp\",\"mtp\":{\"depth\":2}}. The envelope is CLOSED (an
                                 unknown key is refused). Mutually exclusive with --mtp-depth,
                                 which is only the convenience that builds this object.
    --engine-resource <NAME=PATH>
                                 Repeatable. Pass one out-of-checkpoint input to the engine as
                                 `--resource NAME=PATH` on every worker spawn (for example
                                 qwen4exp.ngramRowSource=<dir>, the Qwen 3.8 Flash-Next n-gram row
                                 source directory). The runner needs it to LOAD the model, so it
                                 rides on every spawn. NAME uses ASCII letters, digits, '.', '_'
                                 and '-'; a repeated NAME, an empty NAME or an empty PATH refuses at
                                 parse. PATH is passed through as given: the worker validates that
                                 it exists and has the shape the resource needs, and refuses by
                                 name. The value comes from this command line only, never from a
                                 file inside the submission.
    --contract <PATH>            OFFICIAL ONLY (required). The track fixture whose
                                 `official_scoring_enabled` ARM STATE gates the scored seal: an
                                 official run over a fixture that does not declare it `true` (false
                                 or ABSENT) refuses, pre-GPU, before any score is written. Ignored
                                 on the local modes (they seal no scored artifact).
    -h, --help                   Show this help

    --capture-baseline <REC>     CAPTURE MODE (local-iterate only; refuses every other mode). Runs
                                 the checked-timing leg normally while the track's official baseline
                                 is PENDING, appends this run's prefill/decode seconds-per-token to
                                 the capture record at <REC> (identity-checked; sample CVs
                                 recomputed) and writes NO score and no integrity sidecar. A
                                 captured track refuses the mode by name.
    --capture-timed-only         Only with --capture-baseline (a8 ruling). SKIP the teacher-forced
                                 correctness gate and run ONLY the timed prefill+decode pass, then
                                 append the pair. The engine cannot change between passes of the
                                 organizer's own calibration, so the PLE-SSD-bound gate runs ONCE per
                                 prompt per window (the first capture pass, WITHOUT this flag) and
                                 every remaining pass (A passes 2-4 and all B passes) uses this flag.
                                 Refused without --capture-baseline; never reaches a scored run.
    --capture-passes <SPEC>      Only with --capture-baseline (a8 Option-A restructure). SPEC is a
                                 comma list of per-pass record LABELS, e.g. W,A,A,B,B (warmup + A1 A2
                                 + B1 B2). This ONE invocation runs EVERY listed pass over ONE
                                 persistent model residency, so on MLX the model loads ONCE per
                                 prompt window instead of once per pass. NO pass runs the
                                 teacher-forced correctness gate (dropped from calibration entirely,
                                 David 2026-08-31); EVERY pass is timed-only, with the free-run
                                 oracle token-match as the correctness evidence. Each pass's pair is
                                 appended to <base>.<label>.<ext> off
                                 the --capture-baseline base path; a repeated label (the two A's)
                                 merges into one record. The per-pass MEASURED number is
                                 byte-identical to a standalone single-pass invocation. Conflicts
                                 with --capture-timed-only (subsumed); refused without
                                 --capture-baseline.

    --weights-digest <S:B:C>     Only with --capture-baseline (Option B digest-hoist). SKIP the
                                 per-pass weights re-hash and construct the run's weights digest
                                 from this <sha256>:<bytes>:<files> triple instead — the value
                                 `benchd weights-digest --weights <DIR>` prints. It is
                                 BYTE-IDENTICAL to the per-pass `dir_digest` of the same immutable
                                 tree; the window computes it ONCE at the start and passes it to
                                 every remaining pass so the ~105 GB tree is hashed once, not once
                                 per pass. Refused at PARSE without --capture-baseline: an official
                                 (scored) run always hashes for itself; a passed-in digest can never
                                 reach a scored seal.

const VALIDATE_GOLDEN_USAGE: &str = "\
benchd validate-golden — integrity-pin + load-validate a golden (no engine spawned)

USAGE:
    benchd validate-golden --golden <PATH> --track <TRACK-ID>
                             [--golden-sha256 <HEX> --golden-bytes <N>]
                             [--contract <PATH>] [--gates-only]

--track <TRACK-ID> names the track whose MODEL IDENTITY the golden is judged against: its
model_type, vocabulary bound and seed length. It falls back to env MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_TRACK_ID,
and an undeclared track is refused BY NAME — this command never guesses an identity.

Exit 0 if the golden passes the pin (when given) AND the bench-core loader accepts it;
non-zero with the rejection reason on stderr otherwise. Used by the loader-parity harness
(Rust side) and as a standalone integrity check.

--contract <PATH> supplies the TRACK CONTRACT fixture whose `target.upstream_model_id` /
`target.upstream_revision` declare the track's reference model (#114). With it, a golden
carrying a `model_provenance` block must NAME that model — the same value gate the Swift
reference applies from its compile-time constants. Without it the block is validated for
SHAPE only, and the command says so rather than implying the values were checked.

By default the golden MUST carry a benchmark oracle block (byte-consistent with Swift
preflight, which rejects a benchmark-less golden with 'benchmark golden file must contain
a benchmark oracle'). Pass --gates-only to SKIP that requirement — validating only the
structure + correctness gates — for internal fixtures that legitimately lack a benchmark
oracle.

const CORRECTNESS_USAGE: &str = "\
benchd correctness — run the correctness gate end-to-end (no score.json)

USAGE:
    benchd correctness --engine <PATH> --weights <DIR> --golden <PATH> [OPTIONS]

Spawns the engine (`<engine> runtime-worker --weights <DIR>`) and runs the FULL correctness
set — base teacher-forced cases THEN the golden's anchor / free-run gates (Swift
`runCorrectness` → `runLayeredCorrectness`, checkGates:true). A concise JSON verdict is
printed to stdout; the EXIT CODE is authoritative: 0 = pass, 1 = fail (byte-matching Swift
`mlxfast-swift correctness`, `return report.passed ? 0 : 1`).

The golden need NOT carry a benchmark oracle (Swift `checkCorrectnessArtifacts`,
requiresBenchmarkOracle:false) — correctness is oracle-optional, unlike `benchmark`/`official`.

REQUIRED:
    --engine <PATH>              Engine executable
    --weights <DIR>              Transformed weights directory
    --golden <PATH>              GoldenDocument JSON (loaded + validated by bench-core)

OPTIONS:
    --golden-sha256 <HEX>        Integrity pin (with --golden-bytes): refuse a non-matching golden
    --golden-bytes <N>           Integrity pin (both pin flags must be given together)
    --manifest <PATH>            RunnerManifest JSON. The kit checks the engine's hello against it
                                 BEFORE the correctness set runs: the advertised spec modes are a
                                 subset of the manifest decoders, the capabilities and the cohort
                                 ceiling are the ones the manifest derives, the backend matches, and
                                 the hello carries a runner identity whose manifest_sha256 is the
                                 canonical digest of this file. Each failed check is reported by
                                 name. Exit 1 on a failed check, 2 on an unreadable or malformed
                                 manifest.
    --trusted                    The kit runs as the TRUSTED build, so the manifest derives the
                                 `cohort_reference_replay` capability. Only with --manifest.
    --engine-resource <NAME=PATH>
                                 Repeatable. Pass one out-of-checkpoint input to the engine as
                                 `--resource NAME=PATH` on the worker spawn (for example
                                 qwen4exp.ngramRowSource=<dir>). The runner needs it to LOAD the
                                 model. NAME uses ASCII letters, digits, '.', '_' and '-'; a
                                 repeated NAME, an empty NAME or an empty PATH refuses at parse.
                                 The value comes from this command line only, never from a file

const VALIDATE_WEIGHTS_USAGE: &str = "\
benchd validate-weights — preflight the transformed-weights directory (no engine spawned)

USAGE:
    benchd validate-weights --weights <DIR> [--golden <PATH>]

Mirrors the WEIGHTS half of Swift `BenchmarkPreflight`: the weights path is a real directory
(not a symlink), `config.json` and `model.safetensors.index.json` are present as regular
files, and the directory byte-count (symlinks / non-regular files REJECTED) is enforced
against the size cap. The cap is read from `MLXFAST_MAX_WEIGHTS_BYTES` (empty ⇒ 25 GiB
default; `0` / `none` / `unlimited` ⇒ uncapped; a positive integer ⇒ that cap).

Exit 0 = accepted, 1 = rejected (with the reason on stderr), 2 = usage, 3 = IO error.
`validate-golden` covers the golden half; pass `--golden` here only to also require its
presence (Swift `requiredFiles`).

const WEIGHTS_DIGEST_USAGE: &str = "\
benchd weights-digest — print the weights-tree digest (Option B digest-hoist)

USAGE:
    benchd weights-digest --weights <DIR>

Computes the digest over the transformed-weights directory with the SAME `dir_digest` an
`iterate` pass uses, and prints ONE line to stdout in the stable, parseable form:

    <sha256>:<byte_count>:<file_count>

The value is byte-identical to what any pass would compute for the same immutable tree. A
calibration window computes it ONCE at window start and hands it to passes 2-N via
`benchd iterate --weights-digest <sha256>:<bytes>:<files> --capture-baseline ...`, so the
~105 GB tree is hashed once per window instead of once per pass. Read-only: it spawns no
engine, resolves no baseline, and writes no artifact.

Exit 0 = printed; non-zero with the reason on stderr on a bad flag or IO error.

        [--calibration-bootstrap] [--gates-producer <NAME>]

Runs the alternating serial-control / candidate PAIR LOOP and emits <out>/results.json
(+ .sha256 sidecar, bare-basename body) and <out>/benchmark-integrity.results.json. Runs NO
correctness/gates (those come from the seam-1 GATES PRODUCER — by default the reference
benchmark.sh, per ruling Q1a) and authors NO score.json (that is the overlay, seam 3). Fails
closed (exit nonzero, die 5) when fewer than --min-pairs pairs are accepted.

REQUIRED:
    --candidate <WS>   Candidate workspace (cloned on-box; the MTP spec-decode engine). Its engine
                       is resolved as <WS>/.build/release/<bin> (bin defaults to `mlxfast-runtime-worker`,
                       overridable via MLXFAST_MEASURE_WORKER_BIN); fail-closed if absent.
    --baseline <WS>    Baseline workspace (the serial-control / depth-0 engine); same resolution.
    --golden <PATH>    The timed prompt, in EITHER accepted shape, routed by required-key signature:
                         * TIMED-PROMPT TAPE (what the live timed_prompt_pool PINS): keys
                           seed_tokens / reference_seed_token / rows [+ reference_self_consistent,
                           emitted_tokens]. The legs decode from seed_tokens, oracle the seed forward
                           against reference_seed_token, then check rows[i].sequential_argmax.
                         * GoldenDocument JSON (legacy): keys version / model_type / cases /
                           correctness_gates / benchmark; the benchmark oracle drives the legs.
                       REPEATABLE — pass once per golden; a DUPLICATE DIGEST (same bytes twice) is
                       fatal (die 8). Every golden's sha256 must resolve to EXACTLY ONE --contract
                       timed_prompt_pool entry with a positive noop_decode_speedup (die 8, pre-GPU).
                       The per-golden loop is R7; this component measures the FIRST golden.
    --contract <PATH>  Track fixture (timed_prompt_pool + track_id). Also the review-gated authority
                       for the hidden correctness golden (its `hidden_correctness_golden` sha256+bytes
                       SIBLING pin, LANE 2a) — a SIBLING of timed_prompt_pool that never changes N.

OPTIONAL (LANE 2a):
    --correctness-golden <PATH>  The run's correctness-golden ATTESTATION: the staged hidden
                       correctness golden this run verified token-fidelity against. benchd hashes it
                       (sha256 + bytes) and refuses (die 8, pre-GPU) any run whose identity does not
                       CITE the --contract fixture's hidden_correctness_golden pin. FAIL-CLOSED both
                       ways: a fixture that pins the golden REQUIRES this flag; passing it against a
                       fixture that pins none is refused. Omit only on offline/legacy tracks whose
                       fixture declares no hidden_correctness_golden.

    --min-pairs <N>        Per-prompt floor (>= 1); fail closed (die 5) below it.
                           Alias: --min-pairs-per-prompt.
    --target-pairs <N>     Per-prompt target; stop accepting once reached (>= --min-pairs).
                           Alias: --pairs-per-prompt.
    --tag <S>          Per-run identity sealed into results.json (NOT the track_id).
    --out <DIR>        Output directory for results.json (+ sidecars)

OPTIONAL:
    --tokens <N>       Depth-0 decode window both legs time (default 512).
    --mtp-depth <N>    Convenience for the candidate spec {\"mode\":\"mtp\",\"mtp\":{\"depth\":N}}.
                       OMITTED = the engine's drafter decides ({\"mode\":\"mtp\",\"mtp\":{}} — no
                       depth is requested or sealed; the echo reports the operating value).
                       Depth is a MODULE field now. MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE with
                       --candidate-spec (pass one). Bounds-checked against the readonly 32
                       draft-depth cap.
    --candidate-spec <JSON>  Explicit per-module speculative spec for the candidate leg (e.g.
                       '{\"mode\":\"mtp\",\"mtp\":{\"depth\":4}}'), recorded spec_source cli-override.
    --baseline-spec <JSON>   Explicit baseline spec (default {\"mode\":\"serial\"}). MUST be
                       mode==serial: the baseline is the serial DENOMINATOR and is not
                       CLI-steerable off serial (a non-serial baseline is a hard error).
    --weights <DIR>    OVERRIDE for the transformed weights directory. Spawned as `<engine>
                       runtime-worker --weights <DIR>` for BOTH legs (backbone/identity case).
                       The approved draft measure-job CLI carries NO --weights: weights are
                       DERIVED on-box from the env `QMTP_TARGET_DIR` (the draft's source).
                       When --weights is omitted the env is used; when NEITHER is set this fails
                       closed with a clear message.
    --gates-producer <NAME>    WHICH seam-1 gates producer the driver used (`benchmark-sh` = the
                               organizer's reference chain and the DEFAULT per ruling Q1a,
                               `facade` = benchd's own --official, `direct-swift` = the weightless
                               fallback). SEALED VERBATIM into benchmark-integrity.results.json.
                               measure-job is seam 2 and cannot observe seam 1, so the driver
                               DECLARES this and measure-job records the declaration; omitted seals
                               `undeclared`, which is the answer for a standalone run with no seam
                               1, not a gap. Any name is accepted (provenance, not a policy gate);
                               whitespace/control characters are refused because the value lands in
                               an artifact. NOTE: a DECLARATION, not an independent verification —
                               see #140.
    --exactness-probe <MODE>   none|once|per-prompt|per-pair (default once). The untimed mtp-verify
                               gate that consumes it is R15; here it is parsed + validated + stored.
    --prompt <PATH>            An explicit prompt file. ALL-THREE-OR-NONE with --prompt-sha256 and
    --prompt-sha256 <HEX>      --target-id: the sha is 64 lowercase hex, the target-id matches
    --target-id <ID>           [A-Za-z0-9._-]+, and the prompt file's sha256 MUST equal
                               --prompt-sha256 (die 8 on mismatch).

                               instead of the staged --baseline tree. ABSENT = the legacy staged-
                               --baseline tree-diff, unchanged.
    --preflight-only           Run the pre-GPU prereq/quiesce checks then exit 0 without measuring.
    --calibration-bootstrap    Skip the BASELINE_CALIBRATION serial-band check and mark for authoring.
    --local-dev                LOCAL-DEV mode: a failed pair retries up to a budget (target-pairs x4)
                               and MLXFAST_MAX_DRAFT_DEPTH may raise the --mtp-depth cap. ABSENT
                               (default) = OFFICIAL: a failed pair is an immediate die 5 and the
                               depth cap is the readonly submission-proof constant (env ignored).
                               It is also the ONLY way to run the paired harness against a track
                               whose --contract fixture is not armed (see below).

ARM STATE:
    An OFFICIAL (non --local-dev) measuring run REFUSES (die 8, pre-GPU) unless the --contract track
    fixture declares `official_scoring_enabled: true`. `false` and ABSENT both refuse — an absent arm
    state is not an armed one. --preflight-only is NOT gated (it seals nothing). Only the track
    fixture arms a track; benchd never overrides it.

ALLOWED MODES:
    The modes a submission may declare are the --contract track fixture's `allowed_modes` when it
    declares one, and [serial, mtp] when it does not. ABSENT is not a widening: a fixture opts IN,
    so declaring `dflash` on one track cannot enable it anywhere else. A declared list must contain
    `serial` (the baseline denominator is pinned serial), must not repeat an entry, and may only
    name serial | mtp | dflash — `dspark` is reserved and refuses by name. A candidate declaring a
    mode outside the list REFUSES die 8, pre-GPU.

    `dflash` is SINGLE-STREAM ONLY (the engine's cohort driver refuses it by name), so a dflash
    candidate keeps the single-stream free-run series even on a fixture that pins
    `scored_batch_size`. The regime it ran is sealed in results.timed_mode, and the overlay's §5
    series fence keeps the single-stream and batched-cohort series from ever being pooled.

ENV (R14):
    QMTP_TARGET_DIR            Backbone/target weights dir (the --weights fallback).
    QMTP_HEAD_DIR              Pinned native MTP head (serial leg); existence-checked when set (die 8).
    QMTP_CANDIDATE_HEAD_DIR    Candidate-leg BYO head; defaults to QMTP_HEAD_DIR when unset.
    QMTP_DFLASH_HEAD_DIR       Pinned DFlash drafter (serial leg); existence-checked when set (die 8).
                               REQUIRED when the candidate declares mode dflash — without it both
                               legs would fall back to the engine's CWD-relative ./dflash-head and
                               load the SAME drafter regardless of workspace.
    QMTP_CANDIDATE_DFLASH_HEAD_DIR
                               Candidate-leg DFlash drafter; defaults to QMTP_DFLASH_HEAD_DIR.
    BASELINE_CALIBRATION       JSON calibration file; the pooled serial mean is band-checked against
                               it after measuring (die 6 on drift or decode_tokens mismatch).
    BASELINE_BAND_ENFORCE      Default 1: a MISSING calibration fails closed (die 6). Set 0 to allow.
    GPU_LOADED_UTIL            Telemetry loaded/steady util threshold (default 0.70; env-driven).

The dropped `MLXFAST_PAIRED_BASELINE_*` env / `--baseline-*` flags (the baseline is a
WORKSPACE now) are a hard mutual-exclusion error if present alongside this subcommand.

benchd overlay-timing — Option-A seam 3 (LOCAL): merge gates + timing into a LOCAL/parity score.json (the organizer owns the published ranked seal)

USAGE:
    benchd overlay-timing --gates-score <gates-score.json> --results <results.json> \\
        --score-path <score.json> [--integrity <benchmark-integrity.json>] [--contract <fixture.json>]

benchd's LOCAL merge and the verifiable seam-3 PARITY reference: it overlays the measure-job
<results.json> (seam 2) onto the seam-1 producer's sealed <gates-score.json> and seals the ranked
<score.json> (+ bare-basename .sha256). Aggregation is the 3.8 MEDIAN regime (median of the
per-prompt raw ratio-of-means; per-pair bound 8.0; floor 0.90 / ceiling 5.0). On the RANKED path
the organizer's trusted shell authors score.json (OPEN-2); this subcommand is LOCAL-only.

Flips partial_result → false, recomputes ALL floor fields coherently for the decode-only paired
track (finding 11), stamps a `scoring_mode` discriminator, and re-anchors integrity `score_sha256`
over the merged bytes (into --integrity when given, else a fresh benchmark-integrity.json).

Exit 0 when the merged score PASSES (median in [floor, ceiling]); nonzero when a floor/ceiling
bound fails (score=null); 2 on a usage error; 1 on a load/validation/IO error.

REQUIRED:
    --gates-score <PATH>  The seam-1 producer's sealed gates-score.json (partial_result=true)
    --results <PATH>      The measure-job results.json (seam 2 superset)
    --score-path <PATH>   Output LOCAL/parity score.json (+ .sha256 sidecar; organizer owns the ranked seal)

OPTIONS:
    --integrity <PATH>    An existing benchmark-integrity.json to RE-ANCHOR (score_sha256/score_path
                          rewritten over the merged bytes). Absent ⇒ a fresh sidecar next to the score.
    --contract <PATH>     R17 pool-shape source: the fixture whose `timed_prompt_pool | length` sets
                          the expected pool_size when MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_POOL_SIZE is unset (fail-closed).
