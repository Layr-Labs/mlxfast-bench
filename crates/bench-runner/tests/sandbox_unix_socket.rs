//! BEHAVIOURAL proof that the official Seatbelt profile's one resident-socket rule actually
//! works — run against the real `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`, not against the profile text.
//!
//! Why this test has to exist: the profile text is not self-verifying. `sandbox-exec`
//! accepts a profile whose rules do not have the effect they appear to have — a malformed or
//! mis-targeted filter COMPILES silently and the connect is still denied — so an assertion on
//! the profile string can pass on a profile that denies every phase worker its connection to
//! the resident `bench-worker`. The path also has to survive symlink resolution: Seatbelt
//! matches `path-literal` against the kernel-resolved path, so a rule naming `/tmp/x.sock`
//! does NOT allow a connect to the same socket reached via `/private/tmp/x.sock`. None of
//! that is visible in the text. So this test opens a real `UnixListener` and runs a real
//! client under a real Seatbelt profile derived by `bench_runner::build_seatbelt_profile`,
//! asserting three things:
//!
//!   1. WITH the rule, the connect SUCCEEDS.
//!   2. WITHOUT the rule, the connect fails with EPERM (`Operation not permitted`) — the
//!      exact failure seen on M5 #4.
//!   3. WITH the rule, a connect to a DIFFERENT (existing, live) socket still fails with
//!      EPERM — the allowance is one path-literal, not a hole in `(deny network*)`.
//!
//! Hermetic: no GPU, no engine, no network, no `nc`. The client is THIS test binary
//! re-executed under `sandbox-exec` (see `resident_socket_client`), which is why the derived
//! profile's `(allow process-exec (literal …))` names `current_exe()`. Re-exec (rather than a
//! separate helper crate) also lets the client report the raw errno, so "fails with EPERM" is
//! asserted as EPERM and not merely as a non-zero exit — `nc(1)` is silent about errno, so it
//! cannot tell EPERM apart from ENOENT.
//!
//! macOS-only: `sandbox-exec` and this whole official-run path do not exist elsewhere.
