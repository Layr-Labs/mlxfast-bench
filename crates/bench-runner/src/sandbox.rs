//! B-2 — official-run Seatbelt sandbox + fail-closed spawn policy.
//!
//! Port of the Swift official-run sandbox from
//! `mlxfast-challenge-dev/Sources/MLXFastCLI/main.swift`
//! (`runtimeWorkerOptions` :1143-1219, `writeRuntimeWorkerSandboxProfile` :1221-1258,
//! `seatbeltEscaped` :1270-1274) and `benchmark.sh enforce_official_sandbox` (:666-719).
//!
//! An official benchmark run executes the (untrusted, submitted) engine under
//! `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -f <profile> <engine> runtime-worker …` with a Seatbelt profile
//! that denies network, fork, exec (except the engine itself), all file writes (except
//! `/dev/null`), and reads of the private golden (+ the private dir). The run FAILS CLOSED
//! — refuses to run at all rather than falling back to an unsandboxed/worker-less path — on
//! ANY of: the worker disabled, `MLXFAST_NO_SANDBOX=1`, no engine executable, no derivable
//! sandbox profile, or `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` missing.
//!
//! ## The one resident-socket exception
//!
//! macOS Seatbelt classifies an AF_UNIX `connect(2)` as a NETWORK operation, so the blanket
//! `(deny network*)` above also denies the sandboxed worker's connect to the resident
//! `bench-worker` Unix domain socket — every phase worker fails with `Operation not
//! permitted`, whatever directory the socket lives in. That made a ranked RESIDENT run
//! impossible on macOS: the worker could not attach, so the checkpoint would have to be
//! re-loaded per phase, breaking the binding "weights load once" rule.
//!
//! When (and only when) `BENCH_WORKER_RESIDENT_SOCKET` names the resident socket, the derived
//! profile therefore gains EXACTLY ONE more rule, placed straight after `(deny network*)` so
//! the later, more specific rule wins:
//!
//! ```text
//! (allow network-outbound (remote unix-socket (path-literal "<socket>")))
//! ```
//!
//! That is the whole widening. It is OUTBOUND only (the worker may connect, never listen), it
//! names ONE path-literal (a connect to any other socket still fails), and it opens no TCP/UDP
//! and no filesystem path. The resident itself is booted OUTSIDE the sandbox by the window
//! tooling before benchd runs, so the sandbox never has to permit loading weights or binding a
//! socket — only the connect to that one already-existing name. The socket path is box
//! configuration (constant across a window, never submission-controlled), and a path that is
//! not absolute or that the Seatbelt escaper cannot represent is REFUSED, never silently
//! skipped — a skipped rule would resurrect the `Operation not permitted` failure at spawn.
//! With the variable unset the profile is byte-identical to the pre-resident one.
//!
//! The predicate spelling was settled BEHAVIOURALLY against `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` on macOS
//! 26, not from documentation. Several filter forms both compile and work — `(literal …)`,
//! `(remote unix-socket (literal …))`, `(remote unix-socket (path-literal …))` and the
//! `subpath` variants all permit the connect. We take `(remote unix-socket (path-literal …))`
//! as the narrowest and most explicit of them: it says outbound, unix-socket, this one exact
//! path, and it cannot be misread as a subtree or as a TCP filter the way a bare `(literal …)`
//! or a `subpath` form could. Note that a profile which merely COMPILES proves nothing about
//! whether the connect is permitted, which is why `tests/sandbox_unix_socket.rs` exercises a
//! real listener under a real `sandbox-exec` instead of asserting on the profile text.
//!
//! This module is macOS-buildable and unit-tested against a STUB (the pure profile builder
//! and the fail-closed resolver take injected inputs, so no real `sandbox-exec` or GPU is
//! needed). The real sandboxed timed run is exercised on the GPU box in B-3.
