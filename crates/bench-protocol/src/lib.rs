//! Engine Protocol v1 — the single normative definition of the benchmarker <-> engine wire.
//!
//! NDJSON over stdio (co-located) or localhost TCP (via bench-agent / compose network).
//! Only token IDs, top-K logits, and RSS cross this boundary; all timing is parent-side.
//! Message kinds: hello, prefill, decode_begin, decode_step, correctness,
//! correctness_begin/_step, phase_diagnostics. See docs/architecture.md §3 and PROTOCOL.md.
//!
//! These structs are a faithful port of the Swift Codable types that define the wire today:
//! - [`WorkerRequest`]  <- `RuntimeWorkerRequest`  (Sources/MLXFastHarness/QwenRuntimeWorker.swift)
//! - [`WorkerResponse`] <- `RuntimeWorkerResponse` (Sources/MLXFastHarness/QwenRuntimeWorker.swift)
//! - [`CorrectnessTraceLogit`] <- `CorrectnessTraceLogit` (Sources/MLXFastHarness/QwenRuntime.swift)
//! - [`ExpertStreamingStats`]  <- `ExpertStreamingStats`  (Sources/MLXFastCore/ExpertStreamingStats.swift)
//!
//! Serde fidelity contract (matches Swift's auto-synthesized Codable):
//! - Optional fields carry `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"` so a `nil`/`None`
//!   field is OMITTED from the JSON, exactly like Swift's `encodeIfPresent`, and
//!   `default` so a missing key deserializes to `None`.
//! - Rust field/JSON-key order matches the Swift declaration order, so parse-then-
//!   reserialize of a canonical (declaration-ordered, no-nil-keys) line is byte-identical.
//! - The Phase-0 `hello` fields (`protocol_version`, `backend`, `device`) are appended
//!   last so pre-Phase-0 messages still round-trip unchanged.
