//! PER-LEG RESIDENT ENGINES for the paired path — on BOTH platforms.
//!
//! A paired run measures two legs from two trees. On EITHER platform the model is owned by a
//! RESIDENT process, and that process belongs to ONE leg's tree:
//!
//! * CUDA: the worker is a thin adapter over a resident `ds4-resident` (`tools/serve-up.sh`).
//! * MLX: the worker attaches to a resident `bench-worker` that holds the ~113 GB checkpoint
//!   (`tools/resident-up.sh`), because an in-process load per phase is unaffordable.
//!
//! Each engine repo's measure script used to wrap the WHOLE benchd invocation in its own resident
//! wrapper, which boots ONE resident for the window. That shape cannot serve two legs: on M5 #4
//! (ranked run 34230122059) the reference leg attached to the CANDIDATE tree's resident and the
//! worker refused — `resident holds <candidate>/weights but this phase asked for
//! <baseline-workspace>/weights`. So benchd boots and tears down EACH leg's resident itself, from
//! that leg's own tree, one at a time.
//!
//! ## The convention benchd drives, per leg
//!
//! Both commands run with the working directory set to the LEG's own workspace. The argv contract
//! is IDENTICAL on both platforms; only the script name differs
//! ([`leg_serve_script`]):
//!
//! ```text
//! <workspace>/<script> --boot --spec <serial|mtp> --draft-len <N> --socket-out <FILE>
//! <workspace>/<script> --stop --socket <PATH>
//! ```
//!
//! * `--boot` boots exactly ONE resident from that tree, waits until it answers a healthy hello,
//!   writes the resident's Unix-socket path as the FIRST LINE of `<FILE>`, and exits 0 leaving the
//!   resident running. It owns its own health timeout; benchd waits for it.
//! * `--spec serial --draft-len 0` is what LEG 1 always gets: the control leg is serial regardless
//!   of what the submission declares. Leg 2 gets the run's declared spec.
//! * `--stop` tears that resident down and is IDEMPOTENT (a resident that is already gone is not
//!   an error). benchd runs it when the leg's [`LegServe`] is dropped — after the leg, on success
//!   and on failure alike — so a resident never outlives its leg and the two legs never hold GPU
//!   memory at the same time.
//!
//! benchd then puts the socket path into that leg's WORKER SPAWNS ONLY, under the names that
//! platform's worker connects by ([`socket_env_names`]): `BENCH_WORKER_RESIDENT_SOCKET` on both,
//! and `DS4_RESIDENT_SOCKET` additionally on CUDA. benchd's own environment is never mutated, so
//! the two legs cannot bleed into each other.
//!
//! ## The inherited socket
//!
//! On the PAIRED path an inherited socket is REFUSED by name on both platforms: one resident for
//! both legs prices the candidate against itself, and on MLX it does not even reach a number — the
//! reference leg's worker refuses the weights mismatch. The refusal is scoped to the paired path,
//! so the SINGLE-resident shapes keep working untouched: a local unscored run has one tree and one
//! leg, and an inherited resident is exactly right for it.
