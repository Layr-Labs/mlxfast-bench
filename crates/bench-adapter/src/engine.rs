//! The generation surface the protocol adapter drives.
//!
//! The adapter talks only to the [`Engine`] trait. A track engine repository
//! implements this trait and nothing else of the protocol: the deterministic
//! [`crate::mock`] backend implements the same trait, so the loop is proven
//! with no GPU and the same code path wires to real inference by swapping the
//! factory.
//!
//! ## THE ENGINE REPORTS RAW COUNTERS AND NOTHING ELSE
//!
//! Nothing in this trait returns a rate, a ratio, an elapsed time or a
//! speedup. `free_decode_run` returns the committed tokens and three integer
//! counters; benchd times the call from its own side and does every division.
//! Measurement lives in benchd. An engine that reported a derived number would
//! be asking to be believed about its own speed.
