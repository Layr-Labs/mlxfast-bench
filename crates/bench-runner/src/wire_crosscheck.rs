//! Captured engine-wire crosscheck — benchd's INDEPENDENT reference of what the real engine
//! emits, pinned by a sha256 both repos hold, re-parsed under benchd's own CLOSED
//! [`WorkerResponse`].
//!
//! The captured bytes ([`ENGINE_WIRE_V1_FIXTURE`]) are CAPTURED from the engine's own Codable
//! encoder (engine test `emitEngineWireFixture`, `.sortedKeys` canonical) — NOT a hand-written
//! literal — and UNTRIMMED: they carry every field the engine emits (the `phase_diagnostics`
//! `mlx_*` memory ints, the hello `head_provenance` / `capabilities` / `spec_modes`, the
//! `free_decode_begin` seam). Both repos pin the same [`ENGINE_WIRE_V1_SHA256`]; regenerate via
//! the engine's `emitEngineWireFixture` and repin BOTH repos intentionally when the wire surface
//! changes.
//!
//! [`verify_captured_engine_wire`] is the ONE crosscheck body: it hashes the captured bytes
//! against the mirror-integrity reference sha256, then re-parses every line under benchd's
//! `deny_unknown_fields` [`WorkerResponse`]. It is shared by the cargo-test crosscheck and by
//! `benchctl measure-job` (which previously ran neither at measure time), so a single definition
//! backs both the offline assertion and the pre-GPU gate.
