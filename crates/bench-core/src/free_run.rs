//! Protocol v1.1 oracle-verified free-run timed decode: the scoring-series identity, the
//! §2.6 consistency TRIPLE, and the AUDIT (`audit_spec_*`) derived metrics.
//!
//! This is the judge-less, scoring-adjacent half of the benchd v1.1 implementation
//! (`cudafast-engine/docs/PROTOCOL-v1.1.md`, SIGNED 2026-08-17 incl. Amendment 4). The
//! wire-driving half (issuing `free_decode_begin` / `free_decode_run`, oracle-verifying
//! every committed token, timing the wall clock) lives in `bench-runner`; this module owns
//! the pure, GPU-free rules it depends on so they are unit-testable without a transport:
//!
//! - the **series tag** (§5): a v1.1 free-run number is a NEW SERIES and MUST NEVER be
//!   compared to a v1 teacher-forced number ([`timed_modes_comparable`]);
//! - the **consistency TRIPLE** (§2.6): `R == acceptance_lengths.len()`,
//!   `sum(acceptance_lengths) == N`, `completed_work == R + 1`, plus
//!   `committed_total == N == tokens.len()` and `drafted_total >= accepted_total`
//!   ([`verify_consistency`]);
//! - the **AUDIT** derived metrics (§3): the flat `audit_spec_*` family, computed from the
//!   engine's self-reported acceptance counters, all explicitly NON-scored ([`FreeRunAudit`]).
//!
//! # v1.2 — the COHORT (batched) generalization
//!
//! The batch-8 design brief moves the unit of measurement from the STREAM to the COHORT: B streams,
//! one window, one number. This module gains the batched twins —
//! [`CohortFreeRunResponse`] / [`verify_cohort_consistency`] / [`CohortFreeRunAudit`] — and the
//! per-batch series tag ([`timed_mode_batched_free_run`]). Three properties are worth stating
//! rather than leaving to be re-derived:
//!
//! - **`acceptance_lengths` stays a SINGLE vector.** CBv2 commits ONE COMMON WIDTH per round, taken
//!   as the minimum across rows, so per-round committed counts are identical across streams by
//!   construction. `sum(acceptance_lengths) == N` therefore holds unchanged in FORM at B > 1.
//! - **`completed_work` stays a SCALAR `R + 1`.** A round is one engine forward regardless of B; the
//!   counter counts forwards, never stream-rounds.
//! - **The scalar equations are single-sourced** ([`check_shared_invariants`]), so `B = 1` through
//!   the cohort verifier runs literally the same checks as the v1.1 verifier — the batched path
//!   cannot drift into a looser regime.
