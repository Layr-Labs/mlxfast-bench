//! #134 — scrubbing for engine-controlled text on its way into a SEALED artifact.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Before #134 the worker's stderr tail never reached a persisted record: it was forwarded to a
//! local terminal (never on official runs) and then discarded with the transport. #134 opened that
//! channel deliberately — an infra reject has to carry the engine's own last words or it cannot be
//! diagnosed — and opening it created a NEW way for engine-controlled bytes to land in
//! `results.json` / `score.*.json`.
//!
//! [`redact_worker_stderr_line`](crate::redact_worker_stderr_line) is NOT sufficient for that. It
//! is a keyword filter (`expected` / `actual`) ported from Swift, aimed at ONE threat: a submitted
//! model leaking golden tokens. It does nothing about the shape of secret that a crashing worker
//! actually prints — absolute paths naming the private golden and the operator's home directory,
//! `user@host` strings, and `KEY=VALUE` environment dumps. A line with none of its trigger
//! keywords passes through byte-for-byte.
//!
//! ## Secret-tier rule
//!
//! Program rule: endpoint hostnames, R2/bucket URLs, golden paths and M5 credentials live in
//! `.env` / ssh-config ONLY, and are referenced elsewhere by alias — never reproduced in repos,
//! issues, PRs or artifacts. A sealed `results.json` is an artifact and travels with the run, so
//! this module fails SAFE: anything path-shaped, host-shaped, URL-shaped or credential-shaped is
//! replaced with a sentinel, and only the non-sensitive remainder (exit status, error class,
//! prose, and a path's BASENAME) survives — which is the part that carries the diagnosis.
//!
//! Over-redaction is the intended failure direction: losing a directory name costs a little
//! context, sealing a secret costs a rotation.

/// Replaces the directory part of an absolute path; the basename is kept because it is what names
/// the failure (`config.json`, `model.safetensors`).
const PATH_SENTINEL: &str = "<path>";
/// Replaces any token carrying a URI scheme (`https://…`, `s3://…`, `file://…`).
const URL_SENTINEL: &str = "<url>";
/// Replaces any `user@host`-shaped token (also covers bare email addresses).
const USERHOST_SENTINEL: &str = "<user@host>";
/// Replaces the VALUE of a `KEY=VALUE` / `KEY: VALUE` token whose key looks credential-bearing.
const SECRET_SENTINEL: &str = "<redacted>";
/// Replaces a bare hostname / FQDN (optionally keeping a `:port`).
const HOST_SENTINEL: &str = "<host>";

/// Hosts kept READABLE. A loopback name carries no deployment identity and is a genuinely useful
/// diagnostic ("the worker dialled itself"), so it is deliberately not redacted. Every other
/// dotted name is treated as potentially secret-tier. `127.0.0.1` needs no entry — an all-numeric
/// final label is already excluded by [`is_fqdn`].

/// `sample-001.json` and `api.example.internal` are the same shape — dotted labels with an
/// alphabetic final label — so the two are separated by this allowlist. An unknown extension is
/// therefore treated as a host and redacted: over-redaction is the safe direction, and the
/// basename is only diagnostic sugar whereas an endpoint is secret-tier.
///
/// ACCEPTED over-redaction, and a DELIBERATE non-fix: a missing space after a full stop makes
/// prose the same shape too, so `init failed.See log` seals as `init <host> log`. An allowlist
/// cannot fix that (`See` is not an extension), and the obvious sentence-boundary guard —
/// "a capitalised final label is prose, not a TLD" — was REJECTED: it would let `API.EXAMPLE.INTERNAL`
/// through, and an uppercase endpoint is exactly the secret-tier string this module exists to
/// stop. A TLD allowlist fails for the same reason in reverse, since `.internal` is not a real
/// TLD. Losing one prose word costs a little context; leaking the endpoint costs a rotation.

    /// THREE DISTINCT CAUSES, which is why this is a follow-up and not a wider delimiter rule —
    /// each needs a different part of the token walk changed:
    ///
    /// 1. WRAPPER SPLIT. [`scrub_token`] splits a token on wrapper punctuation and scrubs each
    ///    piece through [`scrub_core`], so a wrapper-laden token never reaches the token-level
    ///    [`credential_slot`] rule. `scrub_core` can only redact the value slot inside its own
    ///    piece; the secret in the next whitespace token survives.
    /// 2. DETACHED-COLON SUFFIX. The bare-colon branch of [`credential_slot`] requires the next
    ///    token to be EXACTLY `":"`. `Authorization :Bearer …` puts the scheme in the same token
    ///    as the colon, so neither the in-token nor the bare-colon branch matches and the line is
    ///    left completely untouched — the worst of the three.
    /// 3. PATH ABSORPTION. [`is_path_like`] claims the token first, and [`abbreviate_path`]
    ///    replaces a shallow path WHOLE — so the credential key disappears into `<path>` before
    ///    the credential rule can fire on it, and the secret in the next token survives.
