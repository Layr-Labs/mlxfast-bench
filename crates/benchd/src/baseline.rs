//! The PER-BOX baseline surface of the ranked paired path (David ruling 2026-09-08).
//!
//! A ranked run of a [`bench_core::constants::LIVE_CONTROL_LEG_TRACKS`] track measures TWO legs on
//! ONE box in ONE job, on the one fixed prompt the fixture's live golden carries:
//!
//! 1. a SERIAL-CONTROL leg on the organizer-staged REFERENCE tree, with no speculation;
//! 2. the CANDIDATE leg on the submission tree, at its declared draft depth.
//!
//! The score is the live ratio of the two. There is NO stored pair: not in the constants, not in
//! the fixture, not in the golden. This module owns everything around that ruling that is not a
//! measurement — the two runner inputs, the per-box calibration file, and every refusal by name:
//!
//! * [`resolve_workspace`] / [`load_calibration`] — the two required inputs, from the flags or the
//!   [`BASELINE_WORKSPACE_ENV`] / [`BASELINE_CALIBRATION_ENV`] environment variables;
//! * [`BaselineCalibration::check_identity`] — the file names THIS track and THIS box;
//! * [`BaselineCalibration::check_band`] — the control leg's measured seconds-per-token sit inside
//!   this box's HEALTH BAND. The band is a health gate on leg 1 and NEVER a denominator: no number
//!   in the file reaches the score;
//! * [`refuse_golden_with_stored_pair`] / [`refuse_stored_baseline_override`] — a golden carrying
//!   `benchmark.baseline_*_seconds_per_token`, and the `MLXFAST_PAIRED_BASELINE_*` env /
//!   `--baseline-*` flags, are refused on this path because each is a stored denominator.
//!
//! It also owns the AUTHORING half: [`calibration_from_passes`] turns the N control legs
//! `benchd calibrate-baseline` measured into the file, and refuses by name
//! ([`bench_core::constants::CALIBRATION_CV_EXCEEDED`]) when the box is too noisy for the mean to
//! describe it.
